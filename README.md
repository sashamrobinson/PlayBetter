(CONCEPT DESIGNS, NOT ACTUAL PROJECT)
<p></p>

PlayBetter is an interactive music player application that was conceptualized, designed and implemented over the span of 5 months as part of a 4-person group culminating project. It was designed in Figma and fully built using Java with Maven to fit a certain assignment criteria. The entire project was built with an emphasis on an intuitive, easy-to-use GUI, responsive quick controls and the potential for further scalability.

As the project leader, I was responsible for delegating work to other members, organizing weekly team scrums to discuss the project, establishing project sprint deadlines for certain features and fostering a productive environment surrounding the project. As well as organizing the project, I was responsible for much of the designing process and implementation process. Specifically, I was responsible for implementing many user interface elements, applying sorting algorithms, structuring code files and many other smaller parts.

While the project is certainly not a full application and acts as more of a working demo, I learned a lot about how to write production code and how group software developement and collaboration works.
